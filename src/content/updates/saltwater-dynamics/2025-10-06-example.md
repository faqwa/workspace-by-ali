## Papers Reviewed

Went through 6 recent papers on plasma-liquid interactions, focusing on saltwater specifically. Most research is for industrial wastewater treatment, but the physics applies.

## Key Findings

### 1. Electric Double Layer Effects

The plasma creates a strong electric field at the liquid interface, causing ions to accumulate in a thin boundary layer (~10 nm). This affects:

- Current distribution through the liquid
- Reactive species concentration near surface
- Arc attachment point stability

### 2. Thermal Gradients Drive Convection

Temperature differences of 200-400°C between plasma and bulk liquid create strong convection currents. This might be why our arc becomes unstable - the convection disrupts the current path.

**Possible solution:** Run shorter pulses or add stirring to maintain uniform temperature.

### 3. NaCl Concentration Sweet Spot

Most papers report optimal plasma formation at 2-4% NaCl by weight. Below 2%, insufficient conductivity. Above 4%, too much joule heating and bubble formation.

Our current 3.5% is right in the range, so that's good.

## Implications for ArcUp

1. **Arc stability issue might be thermal** - need better cooling or pulsed operation
2. **Electrode positioning matters** - should be in the convection flow, not fighting it  
3. **Consider pH effects** - saltwater plasma generates reactive chlorine species that change pH over time

## Questions to Investigate

- Can we model the convection patterns in our specific geometry?
- Would pulsed DC improve stability vs continuous arc?
- How fast does the saltwater chemistry change during operation?

## Next Experiments

Based on this review, I want to try:

1. Running 5-second on, 5-second off pulses
2. Measuring temperature profile with IR camera
3. Testing pH before and after plasma treatment
