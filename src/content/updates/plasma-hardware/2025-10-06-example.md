## Background

The previous electrode housing (v2) had two major issues:

1. Poor heat dissipation leading to thermal runaway after 30 seconds
2. Fixed electrode geometry made testing different designs difficult

## New Design Features

### Modular Electrode Mount

Created a threaded insert system that allows quick electrode swaps without disassembling the entire housing. This should speed up iteration cycles significantly.

### Thermal Management

- Added fins to outer housing for passive cooling
- Increased wall thickness from 2mm to 4mm for better heat capacity
- Created channels for potential active cooling later

### Materials

Currently prototyping in PLA to test fit, but final version will be:
- PETG for main housing (better heat resistance)
- Aluminum inserts for electrode mounts
- Silicone gaskets for water sealing

## Next Steps

- Print prototype in PLA
- Test fit with existing electrodes
- Order PETG filament for final print
- Design jig for drilling precise electrode holes
- Test thermal performance with IR camera

## Questions I Have

1. Should I add active cooling (fan/water) or is passive enough?
2. What's the ideal electrode spacing for saltwater plasma?
3. Anyone have experience with high-temperature gasket materials?

## Related Work

This builds on the circuit redesign from last week - the new housing needs to accommodate the larger transformer.
