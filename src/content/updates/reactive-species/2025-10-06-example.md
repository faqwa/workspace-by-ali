## Experimental Setup

**Goal:** Generate stable plasma arc in saltwater to begin characterizing reactive species production.

**Configuration:**
- Graphite electrodes (6mm diameter, 15mm gap)
- 3.5% NaCl solution (35g salt per liter DI water)
- Power supply: 12V, 2A (adjustable)
- Container: Glass beaker, 500ml
- Room temperature (~22°C)

## What Happened

Started at low voltage (6V) and gradually increased. Arc initiated around 9V with a bright white-blue plasma.

**Timeline:**
- 0s: Arc forms, stable, beautiful glow
- 2s: Arc still stable, water starting to heat
- 5s: Arc begins flickering
- 7s: Arc extinguishes, cannot reignite without moving electrodes
- 10s: Shut down experiment

## Observations

### Visual

- Plasma was white-blue, consistent with sodium emission
- Bubble formation at both electrodes (likely H₂ and Cl₂)
- Water became cloudy near electrodes
- Small particles (probably carbon) released into water

### Measurements

- Initial current: 1.8A
- Peak temperature (IR gun): ~85°C at 5s mark
- Final current before extinction: 0.9A

### Electrode Condition

- Anode showed significant erosion (lost ~1mm)
- Cathode had carbon deposits
- Both electrodes discolored

## Hypotheses for Instability

1. **Electrode erosion** - changing geometry affects arc attachment
2. **Bubble formation** - gas bubbles disrupt current path
3. **Thermal convection** - hot water rises, cold sinks, moves arc around
4. **Salt depletion** - electrolysis near electrodes changes local conductivity

I think #3 (convection) is the main culprit based on the literature review.

## Next Steps

- Repeat test with IR camera to visualize temperature distribution
- Try pulsed operation (5s on, 5s off)
- Test different electrode materials (tungsten, stainless steel)
- Add pH probe to track water chemistry changes
- Attempt spectroscopy to identify reactive species

## What I Learned

Even though the arc wasn't stable, this proves the concept works. We can make plasma in saltwater. Now it's about optimization and measurement.

The electrode erosion is concerning for longevity but might not matter for short experimental runs.

## Questions

1. Is 5 seconds of stable arc enough to generate measurable reactive species?
2. Should I prioritize arc stability or move to measurement?
3. What's the cheapest way to do basic spectroscopy?
