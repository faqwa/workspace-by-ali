# Phase 5: Federation & Discovery (Future)

**Timeline:** TBD (Post-Launch Feature)
**Goal:** Connect multiple Commons nodes and enable cross-project discovery

---

## Vision

Phase 5 transforms Workspace from isolated project instances into a federated network of research Commons, enabling:
- Discovery of researchers and projects across the ecosystem
- Cross-project collaboration
- Knowledge graph of research connections
- Decentralized research infrastructure

**Note:** This phase is aspirational and will be refined based on Phase 1-4 learnings and user feedback.

---

## Potential Deliverables

### Multi-Commons Network
- Protocol for Commons nodes to communicate
- Federated identity system
- Cross-Commons search
- Shared ontologies and schemas

### Discovery Features
- Researcher directory across all Commons
- Project discovery engine
- Topic-based browsing
- Recommendation system

### Collaboration Tools
- Cross-workspace messaging
- Collaborative editing
- Shared datasets
- Joint projects

### Notification System
- Subscribe to researchers
- Follow projects
- Topic alerts
- RSS/Atom feeds per project

---

## Technical Exploration Areas

### Federation Protocol
Research existing protocols:
- [ ] ActivityPub (Mastodon, etc.)
- [ ] AT Protocol (Bluesky)
- [ ] Matrix protocol
- [ ] Custom protocol for research

### Decentralization Options
- [ ] Self-hostable Commons instances
- [ ] Peer-to-peer data sharing
- [ ] IPFS for content addressing
- [ ] Blockchain for provenance (if appropriate)

### Search Infrastructure
- [ ] Elasticsearch or MeiliSearch
- [ ] Full-text search across all content
- [ ] Semantic search with embeddings
- [ ] Faceted filtering

## Governance Questions

- How do new Commons join the network?
- Who moderates cross-Commons interactions?
- How to handle conflicts between Commons policies?
- Funding model for network infrastructure?
- Privacy in a federated system?

---

## Research Needed

- User research: Do researchers want federation?
- Technical research: Which protocol fits best?
- Legal research: Data sovereignty implications
- Community research: Governance models

---

## Success Metrics (To Be Defined)

- Number of federated Commons nodes
- Cross-Commons collaboration rate
- Discovery-to-connection conversion
- User satisfaction with discovery features
- Network effects on research output

---

## Timeline Considerations

Phase 5 should only begin after:
1. Phase 1-4 are stable and well-adopted
2. Clear user demand for federation exists
3. At least 5 active Commons instances
4. Resources available for R&D
5. Community consensus on approach

**Estimated Start:** 12-18 months after initial launch
