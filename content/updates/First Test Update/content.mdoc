This is a test update created to demonstrate the Keystatic CMS integration.

## What I learned today

- Keystatic stores content as **Git files** rather than in a database
- Updates are now managed through the `/keystatic` CMS interface
- Content is stored in `content/updates/` directory

## Next steps

1. Create more updates via Keystatic
2. Test the timeline view on the updates page
3. Verify that all content renders properly

This is working great! <‰
